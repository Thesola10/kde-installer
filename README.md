# The KDE installer for EPITECH's Fedora distro

Here at EPITECH, we are given a USB drive with Fedora at the beginning of our first year. The problem? The desktop that ships with it is **UGLY**.

So this script installs and cleans up KDE _automagically_, for your enjoyment! :)

## THIS SCRIPT WILL MODIFY SYSTEM FILES. DO **NOT** INTERRUPT IT, OR YOU WILL BE LEFT WITH NO DESKTOP WHATSOEVER.

If you wanna see what it does, ~~look at the source code ya doofus~~ simply run `kde-install.sh --phony`.

Download using `curl https://github.com/Thesola10/kde-installer/raw/master/kde-install.sh > kde-install.sh`
